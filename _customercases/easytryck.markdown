### Why did you choose ShimmerCat?
In connection to a major update of our web shop platform, we also wanted to improve the performance of our web server. After some googling on new technologies such as HTTP/2, we noticed that ShimmerCat was literally the only service provider that focused on that type of server solutions. We contacted them and quickly noticed that ShimmerCat stood out from other web server vendors since they have a genuine interest in delivering solutions according to our wishes and requirements.


### What is the result of the collaboration?
We have experienced huge speed improvement, and the service and support is also significantly better. The ShimmerCat team is fast and competent, and we appreciate having direct contact with dedicated technicians at ShimmerCat.
