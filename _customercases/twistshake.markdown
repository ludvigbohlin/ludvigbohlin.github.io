**Twistshake is one of Sweden's fastest growing companies with their niche children's products sold worldwide. The company is facing an even greater expansion in 2019. Since November the week before Black Friday, Twistshake and ShimmerCat are collaborating on establishing a global acceleration network, with server sets combining ShimmerCat's market-leading priority and HTTP / 2 Push technology.**

Twistshake's products are sold in over 70 markets and recently Eequity made an investment of 45 million. Since November of the week before Black Friday, Twistshake and ShimmerCat are collaborating on establishing a global acceleration network, with server sets combining ShimmerCat's market-leading priority and HTTP/2 Push technology.

#### What is ShimmerCat helping you with Twistshake with?
At Black friday most recently, we faced a problem with our site being unable to handle the pressure. Via Eequity's recommendation, we contacted ShimmerCat just three days before Black Friday. ShimmerCat established their load balancer with their AI drive filtering, which was greatly reduced in the application servers. In combination with this, a global acceleration network was established, with server sets combining ShimmerCat's market-leading priority and HTTP / 2 push technology. Our charging time was greatly improved globally especially for mobile formats.

#### What is the result of the collaboration with ShimmerCat?
The first part is that as a company we, despite the problem with Black Friday, slipped through the week without problems and with faster loading times globally. During the intensive period we received support 24/7 and ShimmerCat also helped our partners with corrections. Next, we will use ShimmerCat's new technology for automatic image optimization and prioritized image loading.

#### How do you / you feel that it is to cooperate with ShimmerCat?
We got a personal and fast-footed service that made extra value for us, which ensures that we choose the right partners. The technology itself has dramatically reduced our administrative costs of a technical set as much is automated.

#### What would you like to tell others about experiencing problems with charging times?
It is a complex problem and difficult to measure! But I would warmly recommend contacting shimmerCat. Their offer and its technology cannot be compared with others on the market.
