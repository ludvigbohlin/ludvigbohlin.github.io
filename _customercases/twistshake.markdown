**Twistshake is one of Sweden's fastest growing companies with their niche children's products sold worldwide. The company is facing an even greater expansion in 2019. Since the week before Black Friday, Twistshake and ShimmerCat have setup a global acceleration network, with servers utilizing ShimmerCat's market-leading priority and HTTP/2 Push technology.**

Twistshake's products are sold in over 70 markets, and recently the Eequity, the leading Nordic investor in rapidly growing global e-commerce, made an investment of 45 million in the company. Since the week before Black Friday, Twistshake and ShimmerCat have setup a global acceleration network, with servers utilizing ShimmerCat's market-leading priority and HTTP/2 Push technology.

#### How is ShimmerCat helping Twistshake?
During Black Friday, we faced some problems caused by increased traffic load to our website. Via Eequity's recommendation, we contacted ShimmerCat just three days before Black Friday. ShimmerCat were quick to setup their solution with load balancing and automatic bot filtering, which significantly reduced the load in the application servers. In combination with this, a global acceleration network was setup with servers using the ShimmerCat technolgy to speed up the site with HTTP/2 push and strategic asset prioritisation. Our loading times improved a lot globally - especially for mobile formats.

#### What is the result of the collaboration with ShimmerCat?
The main result is that we were able to handle the increased traffic during Black Friday without any problems, and with faster loading times globally. During the intensive period we received support 24/7, and ShimmerCat also helped our service providers with useful advice and support. Another result is that we now will start using ShimmerCat's new technology for automatic image optimization and prioritized image loading to further improve performance.

#### Describe the collaboration with ShimmerCat?
We get a personal and fast-footed service that creates extra value for us, and also ensures that we choose the correct partners. The technology itself has dramatically reduced our administrative costs on the technical side since it is mostly automated.

#### What would you like to say to other e-commerces that face the challenge of slow loading times?
It is a complex problem that firstly is difficult to measure correctly, and secondly is challenging to solve! But I would warmly recommend contacting ShimmerCat. Their offer and their technology cannot be compared with others on the market.
