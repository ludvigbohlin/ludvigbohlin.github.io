Cohort analysis Cohort analysis is an analytical technique that categorizes and divides data into groups with common characteristics prior to analysis. Customer segments Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics OKR OKRs, or \u201cobjectives and key results,\u201d are a goal setting methodology that can help teams set measurable goals. AOV Average order value (AOV) tracks the average dollar amount spent each time a customer places an order on a website or mobile app. Churn Analysis Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company's customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it. CLV Customer Lifetime Value RFM Analysis The \u201cRFM\u201d in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using three key factors: how recently a customer has transacted with a brand how frequently they\u2019ve engaged with a brand how much money they\u2019ve spent on a brand\u2019s products and services Price sensitivity Price sensitivity is the degree to which demand changes when the cost of a product or service changes. Basket Analysis Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.

Steps: 1. Create a new source called currency_rates with \u201ccurrency_tag\u201d as id, now paste the query provided further down under \u201cQuery\u201d 2. Modify the url in the query to gather the currencies found in the dataset you\u2019re working with (Remove/add for example EUR, NOK) 3. The target should be edited to match the most common currency. For example a Swedish small local business should have SEK as target, and a Norwegian company should have NOK as target. 4. The from_date is changed to match the first transaction in the dataset the customer has. To do this, go to the source where you want to add currency rates (for example model - interactions), create a new query and make the same connection as query 1, in the new query, paste: SELECT MIN(ts) AS min_ts FROM import file, picture below for reference! Copy this timestamp, go to a unixtimestamp converted and check what date this is, and edit the from_date . DO NOT SAVE THE NEW QUERY 5. At the end of the query you want to add currency rates to, add the following row: LEFT JOIN currency_rates AS cr on cr.currency_tag = step1.currency_tag This results in the following: Query: SELECT concat(`date`, currency) AS currency_tag, `date` AS `date`, currency AS currency, conv_date AS conv_date, conv AS conv Back to top Creating new platform [ ] Open ib-kube repo [ ] Check customer\u2019s domain name, match platform name with theirs [ ] Create new file in pkg/settings/k8s with name platformname.go [ ] Paste content from another platform with recent build [ ] Redefine: [ ] Var name to platform name [ ] Name: [ ] Subdomain: [ ] Check available ingress (max 15) [ ] Ingress: to available ingress [ ] Follow ingress definition (Ctrl click Ingress variable) [ ] Copy ingress IP (used for dns record) (skicka IP till christian) [ ] Add/remove Args for centra or other integrations [ ] Verify tag (commit version) [ ] Adjust cpu limit and memory parameters if needed [ ] Save File [ ] Open pkg/setting/k8s/k8s.go [ ] Add variable for platform data to Platforms variable by appending to list [ ] Save File [ ] Open terminal in VS code and run git pull [ ] Then run make yaml (ignore errors) [ ] Go to Source Control [ ] Commit your changes with message (e.g. \u201ccreated platform NAME on COMMIT VERSION \u201d [ ] Push to repo [ ] [Request someone to] run \u201cmake k8s\u201d [ ] [Request someone to] add the DNS registry [ ] [Request someone to] add to k8s ml registry Back to top To access ib-kube: Install WSL 2 https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-2-windows-10/ https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2 Boot Ubuntu Install VS Code Git clone ib-kube Cd ib-kube Run command code .

B2B Business-to-business (B2B) B2C business-to-consumer (B2C) GTIN GTIN stands for Global Trade Item Number and is a GS1 number used to give products and packaging a globally unique identity LTV Lifetime Value or LTV is an estimate of the average revenue that a customer will generate throughout their lifespan as a customer. Cohort analysis Cohort analysis is an analytical technique that categorizes and divides data into groups with common characteristics prior to analysis. Customer segments Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics OKR OKRs, or \u201cobjectives and key results,\u201d are a goal setting methodology that can help teams set measurable goals. AOV Average order value (AOV) tracks the average dollar amount spent each time a customer places an order on a website or mobile app. Churn Analysis Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company's customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it. CLV Customer Lifetime Value RFM Analysis The \u201cRFM\u201d in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using three key factors: how recently a customer has transacted with a brand how frequently they\u2019ve engaged with a brand how much money they\u2019ve spent on a brand\u2019s products and services Price sensitivity Price sensitivity is the degree to which demand changes when the cost of a product or service changes. Basket Analysis Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together. Query CDPR CFO D2C CTO VAT (moms) A value-added tax (VAT), known in some countries as a goods and services tax I sverige moms (ofta 25%) COGS Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs. SKU A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a scannable bar code, most often seen printed on product labels in a retail store. The label allows vendors to automatically track the movement of inventory. The SKU is composed of an alphanumeric combination of eight-or-so characters.

Back to top Range filter Range filter allows you to only show data in the dashboards where a chosen value is within the chosen limit, for example if you only want to show data for items with prices between 100sek to 200sek. Back to top Filter Filter can be used to only show one category of chosen metric, and update the dashboard accordingly. Back to top Metric selector In the different elements added to your dashboard, for example a bar chart or line chart, there's the opportunity to select *metric* , if you then add a Metric selector and choose a metric, all the elements where *metric* has been chosen, will be updated to match the chosen metric in the Metric selector . Using this will allow quicker changes of the data shown, as you can use the metric selector instead of manually changing the other elements. Back to top Alluvial Chart An alluvial chart can be described as a flow diagram that represents changes in structures over time, for us this is mostly used to represent how segments of customers are changed over time, going from new, to lapsed (lost) customers. (There's a Color scale option under Style where the colors can be changed to blue/green/yellow/red instead of different shades of blue) Example of alluvial chart shown below. Back to top Markov Chart Back to top Table This element adds a table to the dashboard, if the table gets to wide there's a scroll bar furthest down in the table allowing horizontal scrolling. The table can be sorted by pressing on the value/text you want to sort by. Under Style in the edit screen of a table, there's an opportunity to add a Backround bar which visualize how large/small the different values in the table are in comparison to the others. Back to top Pivot A pivot table is used to visualize patterns and trends in large amounts of data, it can for example be used to show amount of lapsed customers per order cohort shown in the example below. Back to top Image grid The image grid shows pictures of products in a dashboard. Back to top Segments Lets you show data for only a chosen segment, these segments can be created under the Segmentations part of the platform. Back to top Categories Similar to barchart, categories let's you choose what category to show data for, when the data is several categories in one cell, for example Color = [red;blue] where red and blue are not correlated. Back to top Text Content The text content element is the most used element, it's basically just text that can be adapted through markdown language, for example # = header1 (largest) ## = header2, ### header3 etc. Back to top","title":"Analytics -> Dashboard"},{"location":"Platform/Analytics/Dashboards/#table-of-contents","text":"Add element Metric Bar Chart Line Chart Default (line chart) Style (line chart) Advanced (line chart) Select group key Histogram Date filter Range filter Filter Metric selector Alluvial Chart Markov Chart Table Pivot Image grid Segments Categories Text Content Back to top","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"Platform/Analytics/Dashboards/#add-element","text":"Back to top","title":"Add element"},{"location":"Platform/Analytics/Dashboards/#metric","text":"A metric is a single number, wich means that you can not show a field in a metric element (a field is an array of metrics). you can convert a field into a metric by writing an expression ex.

Interaction config Fields field alias role Active Interaction Expressions Item config Fields field alias role MLMeta MLFilter Active Item Expressions User config Fields field alias role User Expressions Custom properties Expression syntax (Click house) Data model expression examples Interaction expression User expressions Back to top What is a datamodel? A datamodel can seen as the product of three sources put in a package , an interaction source, an item source and a user source. The interaction config in the data model consists of a user and an item from two of the three sources. When we have created a datamodel and chosen what sources we want, we can start creating information through expressions. These can later be seen in dashboards (dashboard are always based upon a datamodel) However, when a datamodel is used for email analysis, the interaction becomes a specific email sent to a user , the user becomes the one receiving the email , and the email that was sent is treated as an item. Back to top Interaction config Back to top Fields Back to top field This is the name of the given in the source query (it can not be changed in the data model). Back to top alias By adding an alias the the field name is replaced by the alias name in the dashboard and segmentation. In Recommendation the field name is allways shown even if an alias is added. Back to top role Categories Categories is used when data is made up of multiple category 's. The data format for categories has to be [ category1 ; category2 ; category3 ; etc ] Revenue Revenue can only be set on 1 field and should be sales price (EX VAT) . The reason you set mark your sales price (EX VAT) with the revenue role is to generate suggested revenue related expressions. Quantity If a user buys multiple items of the same SKU at the same time this will be either represented as 1 interaction row with quantity x In this case that field should be set to Quantity . for some data souces this will be represented as x interaction rows without a quantity row. Timestamp The timestamp role should only be set to the field that represent the interaction timestamp (when the interaction took place). other timestamps such as return date etc. should instead be set to number. The timestamp role is needed to create suggested expressions. User The User role is set to the key-field that connects the interaction table to the user table. Item The Item role is set to the key-field that connects the interaction table to the Item table. Number The Number role is automatically set to all fields that only contains numbers (you can make toFloat( field ) without error). The number role lets you interact with a field as a number meaning you can make an calculation expressions such as if( field 100). If you want to make a histogram you can only use fields with role Number because you specify the bin width wich can only be done if the field is concidered a Number (does not work if the field is a Category ). Category All fields that can not be classified as a Number are classified as a Category . Category 's are used in for example Bar charts . Enum ??????????? EnumCategories ??????????? Back to top Active The Active toggle button lets you activate/deactivate a field. a deactivated field can not be used in dashboards. Back to top Interaction Expressions Back to top Item config Back to top Fields Back to top field same as in Interaction Back to top alias same as in Interaction Back to top role Categories same as in Interaction Timestamp The timestamp lets you work with unixtimestamp and shows the result in as a datetime (readable format). Format The format role represent the name of the item and is what is shown in the Image grid in the dashboards and in the Recommendations Image The image role represent what field will be shown as a image in the Image grid in the dashboards and in the Recommendations . The image field is usually called something with url . Number same as in Interaction Category same as in Interaction Enum dont know as in Interaction... EnumCategories dont know as in Interaction... Back to top MLMeta The MLMeta toggle button controles what is returned when when you make an API call. This is to give you control what data you want to return to the customer. you dont want to activate MLMeta on all fields because this will result in you return alot of \"trash columns\" to the customer that they have to filter in turn get the relevant data. [Note that you also have to select the role Image and Format for the product to show] (MLMeta is only relevant in the recomendations???? dashboard???) Back to top MLFilter The MLFilter lets you write expressions and filter your data in in the Recommendations . You should only activate MLFilter for the fields you actually want to create a filter for, the reason for this is that when you activate MLFilter for a field this will store all data in the memory and every time the API calls for a recommendation the datamodel have to itterate through all fields with MLFilter resulting in a bad performance on the customers side (when the customer want to load our recomendations on their site the load speed will depend on how many MLFilters you have activated.

The reason for this is simply that uniq() is less demanding. countIf() this counts +1 for each time an argument is correct on an interaction (row). Example : let's say there's 10 interactions (ten rows) in a table with a column that's currency. On 7 of the 10 rows the currency column consists of 'SEK', if we now use countIf(currency = 'SEK') we will get the value 7. sumIf() sumIf(Value that will be summarized when, X = N) Example : sumIf(revenue, currency = 'SEK') uniqIf() multiIf(boolean, result_1, boolean, result_2, ..., boolean, result_n, else_this) multiIf(name = 'red', colour, name = 'big', 'size', 'no data') etc...

The reason for this is simply that uniq() is less demanding. countIf() this counts +1 for each time an argument is correct on an interaction (row). Example : let's say there's 10 interactions (ten rows) in a table with a column that's currency. On 7 of the 10 rows the currency column consists of 'SEK', if we now use countIf(currency = 'SEK') we will get the value 7. sumIf() sumIf(Value that will be summarized when, X = N) Example : sumIf(revenue, currency = 'SEK') uniqIf() multiIf(boolean, result_1, boolean, result_2, ..., boolean, result_n, else_this) multiIf(name = 'red', colour, name = 'big', 'size', 'no data') etc...

The reason user has to be an id column is because when user is the first id column all interactions are sorted on user first. this lets you use expressions such as agg.i wich count number of interactions a user has made. if the interaction table is not sorted on user first the aggregation functions doesnt work. For multiple id columns they are sorted in the order they are written. User,ts,item is sorted first on user, then on ts and lastly on item.

Before Segmentations you need to train the machine-learning model Choose the data model and edit it Scroll to the bottom and enable the ML Engine, see image below, and click Save Make sure the platform has been added to the k8s-ml-registry After the machine-learning model has been trained you can create segmentations. What about the parameters in the ML model? The problem with the model and the parameters is that this really isn't straightforward. In principle you want as much data as possible. The default settings just prevent blowing up the worker with an enormous dataset accidentally. There are a few dataset specific details that may make smaller limits sensible. For example, if a customer has high item turnover and you want to exclude old transactions and items that don't really contribute to current recommendations anymore if they are included in the model. But that is fairly difficult to reason about The default settings should be fine most of the time. Especially if the customer has less than 1000 actively sold items at the moment I wouldn't expect the limits to have much of an effect. The first limit should probably be clarified a bit. Maybe \"Min interactions per item\", because I suspect that it excludes items that have fewer than the specified number of interactions. This makes sense because we can't really learn anything useful about items that have very few transactions (I guess that is fairly intuitive, there's just no information to look at) Back to top Using Auto-targeting Auto-targeting identifies optimal combinations of items and users that helps increase conversion in campaigns. The results are based on the results from the machine-learning models. The result is groups with recommended users-items combinations to use in the advertisements, see the overview below: graph TD; Campaign-- SelectRecipients; SelectRecipients-- Advertisement1; SelectRecipients-- Advertisement2; SelectRecipients-- Advertisement3; Advertisement1-- SelectItems1; Advertisement2-- SelectItems2; Advertisement3-- SelectItems3; SelectItems1-- AddFilters1; SelectItems2-- AddFilters2; SelectItems3-- AddFilters3; Back to top Step 1: Initiate auto-targeting campaign Choose the Auto Targeting tab Create a new auto-targeting campaign by clicking the + icon in the upper right corner Name the auto-targeting model (in the image below Auto-targeting test ), and choose the maximum number of recipients for the campaign. Note that Available recipients indicates the total number of users that exists in the data Back to top Step 2: Choose recipients After the campaign has been created, now it's time to set the recipients (audience) for the campaign. To filter the data for various campaigns, click the filter icon to the right of the user icon Choose a filter according to your needs. In the below image, users have been filtered to contains those with age 20-25 that are registered in Sweden. Back to top Step 3: Create advertisements To set up an advertisement click the + icon under the auto-targeting card. Name the advertisement and click the + icon and Select items to target This will trigger some settings to pop up above. * ignore already consumed : used to block so that users do not end up in a campaign that they already bought from. For example, if you have a campaign including Product1 and a user has already bought that product, then you may want to make sure that the user can not end up in a campaign inlcuding that product. * Trend : If you choose a high trend value, then seasonal trends in sales will have higher weight (e.g. during Christmas more Santa Claus-products are probably sold) * Item.multiplier (?) and Recipient multiplier (?) : These can be ignored. The idea is that you can weight the score for a user or item. Ex: item.price, or user.propensity for item resp. user. But it is experimental and seldom used. Now you can choose to add how many items to include in your advertisement, and what filters should apply. You can also add additionalt filters for the recipients. When ready, press Save and Run . The result will look similar to the image below. You can see the products included in the advertisement, the number of recipients, and an average recipient score and its distribution. The recipient score is a value from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a very strong match between the user and the advertisement. In this case, a recommendation would be to only use the first 30% recipients or so in the advertisement, since the scores for the long tail of users is low. Back to top Clustering Clustering makes it possible to group users and items into a specified number of clusters. For finding cluster, there are three different algorithms that can be used: 1. embedding with item clusters from the trained machine-learning model and users assigned to the most connected cluster, 2. plsa , Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis run separately, and 3. modularity , network-based modularity optimization run separately. embedding is the fastest method since it uses the trained machine-learning model.

Name the advertisement and click the + icon and Select items to target This will trigger some settings to pop up above. * ignore already consumed : used to block so that users do not end up in a campaign that they already bought from. For example, if you have a campaign including Product1 and a user has already bought that product, then you may want to make sure that the user can not end up in a campaign inlcuding that product. * Trend : If you choose a high trend value, then seasonal trends in sales will have higher weight (e.g. during Christmas more Santa Claus-products are probably sold) * Item.multiplier (?) and Recipient multiplier (?) : These can be ignored. The idea is that you can weight the score for a user or item. Ex: item.price, or user.propensity for item resp. user. But it is experimental and seldom used. Now you can choose to add how many items to include in your advertisement, and what filters should apply. You can also add additionalt filters for the recipients. When ready, press Save and Run . The result will look similar to the image below. You can see the products included in the advertisement, the number of recipients, and an average recipient score and its distribution. The recipient score is a value from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a very strong match between the user and the advertisement. In this case, a recommendation would be to only use the first 30% recipients or so in the advertisement, since the scores for the long tail of users is low.

For finding cluster, there are three different algorithms that can be used: 1. embedding with item clusters from the trained machine-learning model and users assigned to the most connected cluster, 2. plsa , Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis run separately, and 3. modularity , network-based modularity optimization run separately. embedding is the fastest method since it uses the trained machine-learning model.
