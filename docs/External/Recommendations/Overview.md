# Recommendations Overview

You can use the platform to create personalized product recommendations that can be added to your website, checkout flow or in email campaigns. By applying `Filters` and `Rules` you can adapt the result to however you desire. 

In the recommendations tab you can configure everything related to your recommendations. 

We have integrations to `Dotdigital`, `Voyado`, `Rule` etc, if you wish for other integrations let us know and we will discuss the opportunities. You can also export recommendations using our API which enables a wide variety of use cases.

Example of recommendations use case can be at page <i><u>[here](../Recommendation-Profiles)</u></i>.
