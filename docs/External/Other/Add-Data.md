## Sift Lab - How to add data 

Adding data to Sift Lab can be done in different ways:

* Using a shared S3-compatible storage, e.g. Google Cloud/AWS, where Sift Lab can access files
* Locally run the Sift Lab agent with access to a folder with files
* Upload files via the Sift Lab API
* Provide a way for Sift Lab to access files using FTP/SFTP

Using S3 is the optimal alternative, and data updates are flexible and can be done for last X days.
