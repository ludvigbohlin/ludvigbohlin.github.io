# Secrets
A secret can be seen as a password we want to hide, but use an alias for. An example of a secret is the API key we need to receive data from a data lake or similar.

When creating a secret you need two things:
* `Label`: the name of the secret
* `Secret`: an API key or similar that we want to store, but that should not be visible.
