# Secrets
A secret can be seen as a password we want to hide, but use an alias for. An example of a secret is the API key we need to receive centra information for a customer of ours. When creating a secret firstly a `Label` is chosen, which means by what name we will know the secret by, followed by a `Secret`, an API key or similar that we want to store, but not visible for us.
