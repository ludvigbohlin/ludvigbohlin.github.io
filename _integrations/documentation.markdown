**ShimmerCat comes with extensive documentation and everything you need to get started quickly and easily.**

The documentation contains detailed information and tutorials that show you how to setup different applications with ShimmerCat, for example:

* PHP
* NodeJS
* Django.

The advantage of using ShimmerCat at development, vs using the bare-bones server is that you get to load your site using https:// and HTTP/2 from minute five. Also you can share your web project setup more easily with fellow team developers.

If you want to know more and test the integrations on your own, check out the <a href="https://docs.accelerator.shimmercat.com" target="_blank">Documentation</a>.
