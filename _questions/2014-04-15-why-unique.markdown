ShimmerCat is fully developed in the new HTTP/2 protocol because it offers improved speed and security, and because it enables performance optimizations (like HTTP/2 Push) that was not possible before. ShimmerCat is also unique in the sense that Javascript is not needed to make performance optimizations, i.e. we make no changes to the website. Also, ShimmerCat provides an automatic way of doing the same thing that cost a lot of money to do by hand for each shop theme.
