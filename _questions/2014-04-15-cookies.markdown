With HTTP/2 Push, the server can do a good guess of what the client needs already from the first request, and send it to the browser. However, for a user that visits a site not­ for ­the ­first time, the server need to know what contents the browser keeps in cache from previous visits. Todo this, the standard is for the browser to communicate an overview of the contents of its cache explicitly. The mechanism is called "cache digests", and it complements HTTP/2 Push.
