ShimmerCat Accelerator includes a Dashboard with performance monitoring data about your website at the edge servers.

The Dashboard gives information about incoming data for your domains. Currently the Dashboard contains metrics about, for example, number of active sessions, the system load, how long time the servers have been up running and taking traffic, the byte sizes fetched and received at the servers from visitors,  and the number of HTTP responses sent by the web server to web browser.
