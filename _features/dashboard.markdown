ShimmerCat Accelerator includes a Dashboard with performance monitoring data about your website.

The Dashboard gives information about website and user metrics, as well as data about incoming logs for each deployment and domain.
Currently the Dashboard contains metrics about, for example, number of requests served, number of requests handled by the backend, processing times and response times.
