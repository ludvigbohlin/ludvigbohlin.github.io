title:  "Image Optimisation"
---
Images often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a web page and also often occupy a significant amount of visual space. As a result, optimizing images can often yield large byte savings and performance improvements for your website: the fewer bytes the browser has to download, the less competition there is for the client's bandwidth and the faster the browser can download and render useful content on the screen.

With ShimmerCat it is possible to automatically optimise images. This is done by inventorying images on the website and optimizing them for the web via a thirdÂ­-party web optimization service. 

The optimised images are produced to be displayed perfectly on all modern browsers including mobile devices.
