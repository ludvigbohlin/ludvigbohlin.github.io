title:  "Image Prioritisation"
---
Even though the e-commerce backend is fast, pages containing too many images can be a performance killer. But by knowing which images are usually seen first by your website visitors, ShimmerCat can prioritize image bytes so that visitors can start interacting with the page faster.

This feature improves loading times further, especially for remote visitors and mobile devices. 

<img class="full-width" src="{{ "/assets/img/features/imageprio.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="80%" height="auto">

#### Identify and prioritize above-the-fold content
Above-the-fold content is the portion of the web page that is visible in a browser window when the page first loads. ShimmerCat can automatically identify the images that are above-the-fold and prioritize these assets that actually matters for the visitor interaction.
