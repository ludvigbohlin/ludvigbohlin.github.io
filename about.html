            <h4>More About ShimmerCat.</h4>
            <p>ShimmerCat provides a technology that you can't get anywhere else. We measure numerous things like how long each individual request takes, which images are most likely to be served in each page fetch, which IP address represent humans and which represent bots, and much much more. Then we use all that data to feed our AI engines, which make decisions that improve the performance of the website.
            <p>We do this with our very own web server software that is able to capture the data we need, but is also able to act on the decisions of the AI engine. Does that IP address represent a bot? Then it should get its data after the humans that are visiting the site at the same time. Is it likely that the page need a specific set of images? Then let's leverage HTTP/2 Push to start delivering them even before the backend starts delivering the HTML response. It's all about performance.</p>
            <p>ShimmerCat was founded by scientist to make a difference. The two early founders Ludvig and Alcides have dedicated more than 20 years combined to make ShimmerCat what it is today. But enough about us. We want to know more about you to be able to improve your website.</p>
