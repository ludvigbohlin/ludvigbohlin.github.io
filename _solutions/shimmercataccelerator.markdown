ShimmerCat Accelerator is a disruptive solution that helps improve website speed. Generally speaking, it is divided into two parts:

* A set of programs, including a HTTP/2 web server, installed in a edge server
* A cloud analysis service where an AI engine runs

The expected results depend on your current setup, but so far we have experienced:

* 30%-60% loading time improvements, defined as time visitor waits to have website ready for first interaction, compared to unaccelerated setups
* Much less bot traffic, and thus enhanced website security
